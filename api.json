      "full": "Kitsune are intelligent fox spirits from Japanese folklore with magical abilities and shapeshifting powers. They can transform into human form, usually appearing as beautiful women, and gain additional tails as they age and increase in power, up to a maximum of nine tails. Kitsune are classified into two main types: Zenko (benevolent foxes who serve as messengers of Inari, the Shinto deity) and Yako or Nogitsune (malicious tricksters who deceive humans). Their supernatural powers include creating illusions, possession (kitsunetsuki), generating fox-fire (kitsunebi), and flight. Kitsune hold immense cultural significance in Japanese society, serving as guardians of Inari shrines and appearing throughout Japanese folklore. Famous stories include Tamamo-no-Mae (a nine-tailed courtesan who was actually a fox spirit) and Kuzunoha (a fox who married a human). In modern times, kitsune remain popular in anime, manga, and are still part of active Shinto and Buddhist spiritual practice. They are related to other Asian fox spirits including Huli Jing (Chinese) and Kumiho (Korean)."
